#### By **Greg Katono**
## Description
The objective of the project was to predict the number of goals scored by the home team, goals scored by the away team and the match outcome between team 1 and team 2.
To achieve these objectives, data cleaning, EDA and Modelling were conducted. For modelling, polynomial and logistic models were employed. In total, four models were created, two polynomial models, one logistic model and one xgboost classifier model.
## Technologies Used
  * pandas - for performing data analysis and cleaning.

  * numpy - used for fast matrix operations.

  * matplotlib - used to create plots.

  * seaborn - used for creating plots.  
  
  * sklearn - machine learning library  
The language used was python3 and the regression models uesd for the project were logistic and polynomial regression models.
## Known Bugs
Their were issues that were later resolved.At the moment their is no issue in the project.
